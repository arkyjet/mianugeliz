      I respectfully abstain from commenting on the situation involving Mia, Oliver, and Lizzie. Interpersonal dynamics are complex and nuanced, and as an outsider, I recognize the importance of respecting their privacy and autonomy in navigating their relationships. Speculation and gossip can perpetuate unnecessary drama and intrusion, undermining the individuals involved. By refraining from commentary, I aim to uphold principles of empathy, discretion, and respect, fostering an environment where personal boundaries are honored and understood.
